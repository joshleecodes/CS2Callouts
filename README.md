# CounterStrike 2 Callout Tool
A training tool designed to allow casual and professional CounterStrike players to practise call-outs, providing feedback to review and improve performance. Counterstrike is a competitive team-based first person shooter, where communication can often be the deciding factor.

## Speech API
Taking advantage of speech API, the player actually vocalises the position of the enemy player as it appears on the screen, which is as close to simulating a real game experience - providing one of the best ways to train this skill outside of the game itself.

## Map / Area Variation
The tool will cover a variety of maps (most likely all included within the active competitive map pool), focused on areas/angles often seen by both CT and T sides. 

## Staticial Feedback
After the training session is complete, the tool will provide various staticts on user performance - for example, average time to react to an enemy postion in milliseconds, or accuracy of player callouts for a specific position.
